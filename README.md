Churn Analysis using Telco Dataset with SQL, Google Sheets &amp; Looker Studio

This project explores and analyzes customer churn behavior using a publicly available **Telco Customer Churn** dataset. The goal is to identify factors that influence churn and visualize actionable insights using **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Looker Studio**.

---

##  Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset using **PostgreSQL** and **Google Sheets**
- Perform churn rate analysis across various dimensions (contract type, internet service, tenure)
- Visualize insights with interactive dashboards and visual tools
- Practice end-to-end analysis using real-world data for business storytelling

##  Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Google Sheets** | Cleaning, pivot tables, churn flags, and grouping |
| **PostgreSQL (pgAdmin)** | Validation, transformation, feature engineering |
| **Looker Studio** | Dashboards, heatmaps, pie charts, bubble chart |
| **GitHub** | Version control and showcasing work |

## Key Insights

- **Month-to-month customers** account for 55% of the customer base but contribute to nearly **89% of the churn**.
- **Fiber optic internet users** on short-term contracts have the highest churn rate (~55%).
- Customers in the **0‚Äì12 months** tenure group show the highest churn.
- Longer contracts (1 or 2 years) significantly reduce churn.
